abstract = {Various types of fuel cells are described, before considering the equations that define their operation. Fuel cells are not limited by the Carnot efficiency which applies to conventional heat engines, but it is shown that they only achieve their extremely high intrinsic efficiencies at very low output. The equations defining the chemical transfers occurring in electric cells are developed initially, and then a new property, electrochemical potential, is introduced to enable further analysis to take place. It is shown that, like combustion, the fuel cell only produces energy when it transforms chemical bonds with a view to achieving equilibrium. Fuel cells are then analysed using the techniques of irreversible thermodynamics to show that some energy is lost under load propelling ions through the cell. Finally, the more practical aspects of fuel cells are considered including the many losses that can occur. Also discussed are the combustion related methods of obtaining hydrogen as the fuel.}

abstract = {Liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE) data of the solubility curves and tie-line end compositions are presented for mixtures of [water (1)+acetic acid, or pyruvic acid, or valeric acid (2)+chloroform (3)] at T=293.15K and atmospheric pressure. Among the studied ternary systems, the largest separation factors give valeric acid. A solvation energy relation (SERLAS) has been used to estimate the liquid–liquid equilibria of associated systems containing a protic solvent. The tie-lines were also predicted through the UNIFAC-original model. The reliability of both models has been analyzed against the LLE data with respect to the distribution ratio and separation factor. SERLAS matches LLE data relatively accurately, yielding a mean error of 18.5% for all the systems considered.}
